! Documentation

The components of this plugin include:

* A background task that:
** performs specified actions when elements are scrolled into view
** updates certain base classes on the `document.body` according to the current zoom level
** if enabled in the DynaView config panel - dynamically stores the viewport dimensions in $:/state/viewport/width and $:/state/viewport/height
* Pre-configured CSS classes to simplify using those base classes
* Usage examples

! Scroll Features

!! Scroll position preservation during refresh

Some recent browsers have a feature called "scroll anchoring" whereby they suppress the apparent scrolling that occurs when elements are inserted or removed above the current viewport. (See https://github.com/WICG/ScrollAnchoring for more details).

~DynaView can optionally polyfill this behaviour for older browsers by setting the configuration tiddler $:/config/DynaView/PreserveScrollPosition to `yes`.

!! Startup scroll position restoration

Optionally, ~DynaView can store the current scroll position in local storage and restore it upon startup. Set the configuration tiddler $:/config/DynaView/RestoreScrollPositionAtStartup to `yes`.

Note that it is not recommended to use this setting at the same time as the "UpdateAddressBar" option.

!! Set tiddler field when visible

The background task detects when elements with the class `tc-dynaview-set-tiddler-when-visible` scroll into view. The first time that they do, the background task assigns the value in the attribute `data-dynaview-set-value` to the tiddler whose title is in the attribute `data-dynaview-set-tiddler`. This assignment can be tied to a reveal widget to cause content to be displayed when it becomes visible. If the class `tc-dynaview-expand-viewport` is set then the viewport is expanded so that the processing occurs when elements move near the viewport.

!! Unset tiddler field when set visible before but then scrolled out of view

The background task detects when elements with the class `tc-dynaview-set-tiddler-when-visible` scroll out view after they have scrolled into view. When scrolling out of view after they have scrolled in, the background task assigns the value in the attribute `data-dynaview-unset-value` to the tiddler whose title is in the attribute `data-dynaview-unset-tiddler`. This assignment can be tied to a reveal widget to cause content to be hidden when it becomes invisible. If the class `tc-dynaview-expand-viewport` is set then the viewport is expanded so that the processing occurs when elements move near the viewport.

!! Update address bar when scrolling

If the configuration tiddler $:/config/DynaView/UpdateAddressBar is set to `yes` the background task detects the tiddler at the top of the viewport and sets the address bar location hash to the title of that tiddler.

Note that it is not recommended to use this setting at the same time as the "RestoreScrollPositionAtStartup" option.

! Viewport Size Features

!! Resize Tracking

Some widgets require re-rendering or refreshing if the size of the viewport changes. This can be accomplished using "resize counting" in two steps:

* Ensure that a DOM element with the class `tc-dynaview-request-refresh-on-resize` is present in the DOM to enable resize counting
* Have the widget check for changes to the tiddler $:/state/DynaView/ViewportDimensions/ResizeCount to detect viewport resizes

!! Viewport Size Tracking

The background task can optionally dynamically update a pair of state tiddlers with the dimensions of the browser viewport.

* Set the configuration tiddler $:/config/DynaView/ViewportDimensions to the text "yes" to enable this feature
* The viewport dimensions can be found in $:/state/DynaView/ViewportDimensions/Width and $:/state/DynaView/ViewportDimensions/Height

! Zoom Features

!! Document Body Zoom Classes

The background task sets the following classes on `document.body` according to the current zoom level.

|!Class |!Description |
|`tc-dynaview-zoom-factor-1` |Set when the zoom level is less than 2.00 |
|`tc-dynaview-zoom-factor-2` |Set when the zoom level is greater than 2.00 and less than 3.00 |
|`tc-dynaview-zoom-factor-3` |Set when the zoom level is greater than 3.00 and less than 4.00 |
|`tc-dynaview-zoom-factor-4` |Set when the zoom level is greater than 4.00 |
|`tc-dynaview-zoom-factor-1-and-above` |Set when the zoom level is greater than or equal to 1.00 |
|`tc-dynaview-zoom-factor-1a-and-above` |Set when the zoom level is greater than or equal to 1.14 |
|`tc-dynaview-zoom-factor-1b-and-above` |Set when the zoom level is greater than or equal to 1.33 |
|`tc-dynaview-zoom-factor-1c-and-above` |Set when the zoom level is greater than or equal to 1.60 |
|`tc-dynaview-zoom-factor-2-and-above` |Set when the zoom level is greater than or equal to 2.00 |
|`tc-dynaview-zoom-factor-2a-and-above` |Set when the zoom level is greater than or equal to 2.66 |
|`tc-dynaview-zoom-factor-3-and-above` |Set when the zoom level is greater than or equal to 3.00 |
|`tc-dynaview-zoom-factor-4-and-above` |Set when the zoom level is greater than or equal to 4.00 |

!! Pre-configured Classes

These classes can be used on any element to control its visibility at different zoom levels.

|!Class |!Description |
|`tc-dynaview-zoom-visible-1-and-above` |Visible when the zoom level is 1.00 or more |
|`tc-dynaview-zoom-visible-1a-and-above` |Visible when the zoom level is 1.14 or more |
|`tc-dynaview-zoom-visible-1b-and-above` |Visible when the zoom level is 1.33 or more |
|`tc-dynaview-zoom-visible-1c-and-above` |Visible when the zoom level is 1.60 or more |
|`tc-dynaview-zoom-visible-2-and-above` |Visible when the zoom level is 2.00 or more |
|`tc-dynaview-zoom-visible-2a-and-above` |Visible when the zoom level is 2.66 or more |
|`tc-dynaview-zoom-visible-3-and-above` |Visible when the zoom level is 3.00 or more |
|`tc-dynaview-zoom-visible-4-and-above` |Visible when the zoom level is 4.00 or more |
|`tc-dynaview-zoom-visible-1` |Visible when the zoom level is less than 2.00 |
|`tc-dynaview-zoom-visible-2` |Visible when the zoom level is greater than or equal to 2.00 and less than 3.00 |
|`tc-dynaview-zoom-visible-3` |Visible when the zoom level is greater than or equal to 3.00 and less than 4.00 |
|`tc-dynaview-zoom-visible-4` |Visible when the zoom level is greater than or equal to 4.00 |
